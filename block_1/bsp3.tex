To prove that \textbf{SUBSET SUM} $\in$ \textbf{NP} we have to define a polynomially balanced and 
polynomially decidable certificate relation for \textbf{SUBSET SUM}:
\newline
\newline
Let $R=\{S'\subseteq S | S'\}$ be a subset of sum of S. \\
This is the case if $\sum (S')$ of it's elements ($S'$) is exactly $t$.
\newline\newline

% $R$ is indeed a certificate relation through the construction: \\
% $S'$ is a positive instance of \textbf{SUBSET SUM} $\leftrightarrow$ the 
% sum of S' elements is exactly t $\leftrightarrow \exists S' \subseteq \in R$.
% \newline
% \newline
% Now we show that the given relation is polynomially balanced:
% \newline
% S' is always $\leq$ then S because by definition a subset sum ia a subset or equal the 
% original set of integer numbers.
% \newline
% \newline
% Next we have to show that there exists a polynomial time algorithm to sum a given subset. 
% For this we can simply sum all elements of S' which is possible in linear time.
% \newline
% \newline
% Since $ R $ is polynomially balanced and polinomial-time decidable, it follows that \textbf{SUBSET SUM} is in NP.

$R_s = \{\langle S,t\rangle\} \| \exists S' \subseteq S \text{ s.t. } t = \sum_{a \in S}a \text{ and } t \geq 1\}$

\noindent $\Rightarrow$ 
We argue that $R_s$ is indeed a certificate relation for \textit{SUBS.-SUM} 
since following holds:

\noindent $S$ is a positive instance of \textit{SUBS.-SUM} $\leftrightarrow \exists$ a certificate
subset $S' \subseteq S$ of non-negative integers, s.t.
$$\sum_{a \in S'}a = t \leftrightarrow \exists t \in N^{+}, s.t. \langle S,t\rangle\in R_s$$

\begin{itemize}
 \item $R_s$ is polynomial balanced since every subset $S' \subseteq S$ of
integer values can be represented in linear space s (array) and
the sum of elements is t.
 \item $R_s$ is polynomial - time descidable since the sum of all elements 
of $S' \subseteq S$ needs linear time. Hence $S'$ can be finished at most in 
polynomial time
\end{itemize}
