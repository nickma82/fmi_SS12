To prove that \textbf{SUBSET SUM} $\in$ \textbf{NP} we have to define a polynomially balanced and polynomially decidable certificate relation for \textbf{SUBSET SUM}:
\newline
\newline
Let $$R=\{S'\subseteq S | S' is a subset sum of S if the sum of it's elements is exactly t\}$$.
\newline
$R$ is a certificate relation by construction: $S'$ is a positive instance of \textbf{SUBSET SUM} $\leftrightarrow$ the sum of S' elements is exactly t $$\leftrightarrow S' \subseteq \in R$$.
\newline
\newline
Now we show that the given relation is polynomially balanced:
\newline
S' is always $\leq$ then S because by definition a subset sum ia a subset or equal the original set of integer numbers.
\newline
\newline
Next we have to show that there exists a polynomial time algorithm to sum a given subset. For this we can simply sum all elements of S' which is possible in linear time.
\newline
\newline
Since $ R $ is polynomially balanced and polinomial-time decidable, it follows that \textbf{SUBSET SUM} is in NP.
