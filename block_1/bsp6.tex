\subsection{solution}

By trying to prove that $\vDash$ is \textit{co-NP-complete} we whave to show that
\begin{itemize}
 \item entailment is in \textit{co-NP} \dots Membership (through reduction) and
 \item NP-hardness \dots co-NP-complete Problem can be reduced to \textit{entailment}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Membership}
And the counterprove for us that we have to show is that:
$\alpha \vDash \beta \quad\iff\quad \vDash\alpha \wedge \neg\beta$ isn't satisfiable.

\noindent We try to show membership through a reduction from \textit{entailment} the well known 
co-NP-complete problem: \textit{co-SAT}.\newline

\noindent Proof $\Rightarrow$:\\
We take a look at \textbf{every truth assignments} for \textit{entailment} what means 
that $\alpha \wedge \neg\beta$ isn't satisfied and therefore \textbf{also true}. \\
The last case - a \textbf{false} \textit{entailment} ($\alpha = true$ and $\beta = false$) 
followes a satisfied $\alpha \wedge \neg\beta$ which is \textbf{also false}.

\noindent Proof $\Leftarrow$:\\
if $\alpha \wedge \neg\beta$ isn't satisfiable the entailment is true.\\
So in case $\alpha \wedge \neg\beta$ is true ($\alpha = true$ and $\beta = false$)
the entailment is not valid too.

\subsubsection{NP-hardness}
We try to show a reduction from \textit{co-SAT} to \textit{entailment}\\

$\alpha \wedge \neg\beta$ isn't satisfiable $\iff \alpha \vDash \beta$\\
And fortunately we already proved this reduction while showing Membership above.\\

\noindent What show's us that \textit{entailment} is NP-hard and complete.
