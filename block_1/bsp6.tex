\subsection{solution}

By trying to prove that $\models $ is \textit{co-NP-complete} we whave to
show that

\begin{itemize}
\item entailment is in \textit{co-NP} \dots\ Membership (through reduction)
and

\item \textit{NP}-hardness \dots\ \textit{co-NP}-complete Problem can be
reduced to \textit{entailment}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Membership}

And the counterprove for us that we have to show is that:%
\begin{equation*}
\alpha \models \beta \quad \iff \quad \models (\alpha \wedge \lnot \beta )%
\text{ is not satisfiable.}
\end{equation*}

\noindent We try to show membership through a reduction from \textit{%
entailment} the well known co-NP-complete problem: \textit{co-SAT}.\newline

\noindent Proof $\Rightarrow $:\newline
We take a look at \textbf{every truth assignments}, i.e. all interpretations 
$I$, which for \textit{entailment} means, that $\forall I$ s.t. $I(\alpha
\wedge \lnot \beta )$ isn't satisfied and therefore \textbf{also true}.

The last case - a \textbf{false} \textit{entailment} (i.e. $\alpha =true$
and $\beta =false$) followes a satisfied $\alpha \wedge \lnot \beta $ which
is \textbf{also false}.

\noindent Proof $\Leftarrow $:\newline
If $\forall I,$ $I(\alpha \wedge \lnot \beta )$ isn't satisfiable, the
entailment is \textit{true}.\newline
So in case that $\alpha \wedge \lnot \beta $ is true (s.t. $\alpha =true$
and $\beta =false$), i.e. $\models \lnot \beta $, the \textit{entailment} is
not valid and therefore it covers all of \textit{co-SAT}. Thus, \textit{%
co-SAT} is \textit{co-NP}-complete. 

\subsubsection{NP-hardness}

We try to show a reduction from \textit{co-SAT} to \textit{entailment}%
\begin{equation*}
\models (\alpha \wedge \lnot \beta )\text{ is not satisfiable}\quad \iff
\quad \alpha \models \beta 
\end{equation*}%
Since \textit{SAT}\ is \textit{NP}-complete and fortunately we already
proved this reduction, while showing the Membership above.\newline

\noindent This show's us, that \textit{entailment} is \textit{co-NP}-hard
and -complete.
