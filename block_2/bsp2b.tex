 \solution{
There is always at least one unique implication point (UIP), namely the
decision node. If it is the only UIP, it is of course the first UIP
(the first UIP is the UIP closest to the conflict node).\\
If there is more than one UIP, only one of them can be the first UIP.
Here the proof:\\
We assume that there are two first UIP's. By definition, they lie on every
path from the decision node $d$ to the conflict nokde $k$, also on a path
which is a shortest path from $d$ to $k$.\\
$p$ consists of the shortest path from $d$ to one of the two UIP's (we
call it $u_1$), followed by the shortest path $p_1$ from $u_1$ to $u_2$
(the other UIP), followed by the shortest path $p_2$ from $u_2$ to $k$.
The shortest path from $u_1$ to $k$ consists of $p_1$ and $p_2$ and is 
therefore longer than $p_2$. So $u_1$ can't be a first UIP, because 
$u_2$ is a UIP that is closer to the conflict node. This means that 
there is only one first UIP.
