\Aufgabe[Sparse Method \hfill \bf (1.5 points)]
Apply the Sparse Method including preprocessing on the formula $\varphi^E$
below to obtain a propositional formula.
\begin{displaymath}
  (x_1 \neq x_2 \lor x_2=x_3 ) \land \big[ (x_2 \neq x_4 \land x_3=x_4
  \land x_4=x_5)
  \lor (x_6 \neq x_5 \land x_6=x_7 \land x_7=x_3)\big]
\end{displaymath}

  \solution{
The sparse method is a decision procedure for equality logic that computes
equi-satisfiable formulas in propositional logic.

Consider formula $\varphi ^{E}$ in equation logic:%

\begin{displaymath}
  \varphi ^{E}: (x_1 \neq x_2 \lor x_2=x_3 ) \land \big[ (x_2 \neq x_4 \land x_3=x_4
  \land x_4=x_5)
  \lor (x_6 \neq x_5 \land x_6=x_7 \land x_7=x_3)\big]
\end{displaymath}

Then the sets of equality literals and disequality literals of $\varphi ^{E}$
are:

\begin{eqnarray*}
E_{=}
&=&%
\{x_{2}=x_{3,}x_{3}=x_{4},x_{4}=x_{5},x_{6}=x_{7},x_{7}=x_{3}\}
\\
E_{\neq } &=&\{x_{1}\neq x_{2},x_{2}\neq x_{4},x_{6}\neq x_{5}\}
\end{eqnarray*}

It is very often the case, that a given equality logic formula $\varphi ^{E}$
can be simplified. Before reducing $\varphi ^{E}$ to a propositional formula 
$\varphi ^{P}$, we have to do some preprocessing for simplifying the
equality formula $\varphi ^{E}$:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Construct an equality graph $G^{E}(\varphi ^{E})=(V,E_{=},E_{\neq })$:

The equality graph has two contradictory cycles, $%
c_{1}=(x_{6},x_{8},x_{7},x_{6})$ and $%
c_{2}=(x_{4},x_{5},x_{6},x_{8},x_{7},x_{4})$.

\item Simplifying the graph $G^{E}(\varphi ^{E})$ by replacing each pure
literal in $\varphi ^{E}$ whose corresponding edge is not part of a simple
contradictory cycle with \textsc{True}.

According to the algorithm, $G^{E}(\varphi _{1}^{E})$ can be further
simplified by replacing literals with \textsc{True}:
\bigskip
\end{enumerate}

Following strictly the rules of the simplification algorithm, the algorithm
replace in this case every literal in the equality formula $\varphi ^{E}$
with \textsc{True}. In order to transform $\varphi ^{E}$ into a
propositional formula $\varphi ^{P}$, we have to make a little trick to
enforce the application of the reduction algorithm. In this case we apply
only one step of the simplification algorithm and replace all literals at
once with \textsc{True}, which are not in the cycles $c_{1}$ and $c_{2}$. So
we get:

\begin{eqnarray*}
\varphi _{1}^{E} &:&(\text{\textsc{True}}\vee \text{\textsc{True}})\wedge (%
\text{\textsc{True}})\wedge (x_{3}\,{\neq }\,x_{4}\vee x_{5}\,{\neq }%
\,x_{6})\wedge \\
(x_{4}\, &{=}&\,x_{5}\vee x_{4}\,{=}\,x_{7}\vee x_{6}\,{\neq }\,x_{7})\wedge
(x_{6}\,{=}\,x_{8}\vee x_{7}\,{=}\,x_{8})
\end{eqnarray*}

\begin{equation*}
\Rightarrow \;\;\varphi _{1}^{E}:(x_{3}\,{\neq }\,x_{4}\vee x_{5}\,{\neq }%
\,x_{6})\wedge (x_{4}\,{=}\,x_{5}\vee x_{4}\,{=}\,x_{7}\vee x_{6}\,{\neq }%
\,x_{7})\wedge (x_{6}\,{=}\,x_{8}\vee x_{7}\,{=}\,x_{8})
\end{equation*}

Then the equality graph $G^{E}(\varphi _{1}^{E})$ looks like:

Recall the theorem,%
\begin{equation*}
\varphi ^{E}\text{ is satisfiable }\Leftrightarrow e(\varphi ^{E})\AND B_{t}%
\text{ is satisfiable,}
\end{equation*}

where $e(\varphi ^{E})$ denotes the \textit{propositional skeleton} of $%
\varphi ^{E}$and $B_{t}$ is a formula that describes the \textit{%
transitivity constraints} (conjunctions of implications).

So $\varphi ^{P}=e(\varphi ^{E})\AND B_{t}$ is equi-satisfiable to $\varphi
^{E}$, iff $\varphi ^{E}$ is satisfiable.

\begin{enumerate}
\item First we construct the propositional skeleton of $\varphi _{1}^{E}$ by
replacing each atom of the form $x_{i}=x_{j}$ in $\varphi _{1}^{E}$ with $%
e_{i,j}$, such that:%
\begin{equation*}
e(\varphi _{1}^{E})=(e_{4,5}\OR e_{4,7}\OR\lnot e_{6,7})\AND(e_{6,8}\OR %
e_{7,8})\AND(\lnot e_{3,4}\OR\lnot e_{5,6})
\end{equation*}

\item Construct the nonpolar equality graph $G_{NP}^{E}(\varphi _{1}^{E})$:
