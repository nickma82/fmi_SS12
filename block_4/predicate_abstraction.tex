\Aufgabe[Predicate Abstraction\hfill\textbf{(1.5 Point)}]
Consider the following program:
\begin{verbatim}
void foo(int j, int z) {
  assume(z != 0);
  int i := j;
  while(z != 0) {
      i := i + z;
      if(z > 0)
          z--
      else
          z ++;
  };
  assert(i != j)
}
\end{verbatim}

The {\em assume statement} at the beginning of the function forces the parameter $z$ not to be 0 when the function is called.

\begin{enumerate}

 \item Argue in your own words why the assertion at the end of the program allways holds, i.e., why the error state can never be reached.

 \item Provide a labeled transition system for the given program.

 \item Provide an abstraction for the labeled transition system that uses the predicates $i = j$, $i < j$, $i > j$.

 \item Check whether the error state can be reached in the abstraction, if so state a trace to the error state and refine the abstraction with suitable predicates such that the error state is not reachable anymore.

\end{enumerate}


\textbf{Solution:}\\
\medskip
\begin{enumerate}
\item The call of the method \texttt{\small assume(z != 0)} in the beginning
of the program forces, that the value of the variable $z$ is not $0$. Since
the semantics of \texttt{\small assume(x)}, means that "by assumption \texttt%
{\small x} holds" and by definition an assumption can never being violated.
Thus, the while-loop will be executed at least one time, regardless if the
value of $z$ is positive or negative.

Since the if-condition inside of the loop controls $z$ by decrementing or
incrementing and consequently the variable $i$ will also incremented or
decremented. Thus, the loop will be executed exactly in $|z|$ times. Since  $%
i=j$ is in the precondition of the loop, the loop is guaranteed to terminate
since $z\neq 0$. Hence, after the termination of the while-loop, the case
that $i=j$ will never reached, i.e. it will never hold.

\item The corresponding predicates for the abstract transition system $%
TS^{abstract}$ (see figure \ref{abstraction_graph}) are defined as follows:%
\begin{equation*}
e\equiv i=j,\quad l\equiv i<j\quad \text{and\quad }g\equiv i>j,
\end{equation*}

where $e$ denotes the case that $(i=j)$ holds and $\overline{e}$ denotes the
that case $(i=j)$ does not hold in the current state. This definition holds
also for the predicates $l$ and $g$.

A possible error trail would be for example $(1,l\overline{g}\overline{e}%
)\rightarrow (2,\overline{l}\overline{g}e)\rightarrow (7,\overline{l}%
\overline{g}e)\rightarrow (9,\overline{l}\overline{g}e)$. Since by the
definition of assumption, an assumption can be never violated, the
error state $(9,\overline{l}\overline{g}e)$ in $TS^{abstract}$ will never
reached.

\item By adding a new predicate symbol $z$ to the set of predicates $P=\{l,g,e\}$
of the abstract transition system $TS^{abstract}$, we achieve a new abstract
transition system. The new predicate $z$ denotes the case that $(z\neq 0)$
holds, whereas $\overline{z}$ denotes that $(z\neq 0)$ does not hold in the
current state. Then the resulting abstract transition system is the same as
shown in \textit{c.)}, but without the path to the error state, since the
states $(7,\overline{l}\overline{g}e)$ and $(9,\overline{l}\overline{g}e)$
will never reached.
